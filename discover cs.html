            The study of computers and other computational systems is known as computer science.
            It is a vast area that covers everything from how well software is produced and constructed to how the algorithms that make up software interact with hardware.
            Computer scientists use logical and analytical reasoning, creativity, design, and programming skills to solve complex problems.
