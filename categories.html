            The study of computers and other computational systems is known as computer science.
            It is a vast area that covers everything from how well software is produced and constructed to how the algorithms that make up software interact with hardware.
            Computer scientists use logical and analytical reasoning, creativity, design, and programming skills to solve complex problems.

            Imagine a world without electricity, and it would be nearly impossible.
            Modern society takes electricity production and distribution for granted,
            yet it's simple to forget that it still requires thousands of skilled graduates each year due to its high level of specialization.
            The study of electricity is a fascinating and constantly developing field,
            whether you're trying to figure out how to wire up a brand-new hamlet or designing the tiniest circuit boards for cutting-edge cellphones.
            To improve our lives, electrical and electronic engineers are creating and developing new technology.
            For the upcoming technology generation, they are developing more effective and environmentally friendly solutions.

            Algebra, calculus, and fundamental arithmetic are only a few of the many methods used in the study of mathematics,
            which includes an education in the numerical sciences.
            Maths as a university topic frequently concentrates on understanding and verifying theories in mathematical and scientific terms,
            or "pure maths," despite the fact that it is a necessary part of many subjects, from economics to physics.

            Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn fascinating theorems and abstract concepts that teach people a variety of abilities
            that are transferable across a number of professions, as well as to come to an understanding of the universe's building pieces
            in areas like quantum physics.
